    <p><b>This is my youtube channel. I started it  about 2 years ago with only 1 subscriber. Its hard to gain subscribers who like your content. Not only is it hard to gain subscribers and supporters, but it is also hard to keep up with your upload schedule. <b></p>
<p> Being a youtuber is very difficult but if you set your mind to it you can do anything!

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p> I am trying to make my website accessible to my youtube channel and also to just learn about my background and why, when,and how I started youtube.Other people had cool backgrounds, they copied the image address and put it in a code and it was there. So far I am most proud of learning how to make a paraghraph, a heading centering images, adding a background and adding an image.</p>

    <p>variables,loops,conditionals, and functions.in python a definition of variables is that they are memory location to store value. Loops on python ais a code that repeats but instead of having to re-write the code over and over to make a certain shape you can make a loop that will make any shape when you type a certain amout of sides and is much faster than re-writing a code over and over.
Write the arguments inside the opening and closing parentheses of the function, and end the declaration with a colon. Conditionals in python are words like if or elif, for example you can write if user_input = right then print you go to the right elif userinputleft the print go left. An example for function in python is Def followed by the function name for example def(drawshapes) that would be your function</p>

    <h2> Reflection obamicon </h2>
    <p> A list for example groceries[eggs,bread,cheese,tomatoes] groceries would be the the variable and you define the variable with a name but
      in this example you define groceries in a list of items. this can be useful because instead of writing a bunch of codes to define this and that
      you can make a list and won't have to do so much work. I felt like working with amara it really helped me because she know how to do things I
      don't know how to do and we helped each other out.<p/>

    <h2> Robotics </h2>
    <p> Robotics really doesn't interest me, I got really bored just trying to get the LED to light up and getting to move was a pain in the butt.
    But in robotics we learned how to move the robot using the servo lybrary. we also put wires in the bread board in certain places and the resister
    to turn on the LED light.</p>
    <h2> Gibson Dunn </h2>
    <p> I enjoyed what the speakers had to say, especially the last speakers, they had a video about LGBT and were funny, they were also interactive 
      and called on random people when they asked questions. </p>
    <p id="demo">Awww I'm too small for your eyes to see then hit the click me button and see what happens. After refresh the page so the next person
    can see what the button does.</p>
