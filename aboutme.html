    <p><b>This is my youtube channel. I started it  about 2 years ago with only 1 subscriber. Its hard to gain subscribers who like your content. Not only is it hard to gain subscribers and supporters, but it is also hard to keep up with your upload schedule. <b></p>
<p> Being a youtuber is very difficult but if you set your mind to it you can do anything!

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p> I am trying to make my website accessible to my youtube channel and also to just learn about my background and why, when,and how I started youtube.Other people had cool backgrounds, they copied the image address and put it in a code and it was there. So far I am most proud of learning how to make a paraghraph, a heading centering images, adding a background and adding an image.</p>
